    "1. **✅ Chargement réussi** du corpus AMI avec configuration SDM (Single Distant Microphone)\n",
    "2. **✅ Vérification du signal mono** (configuration SDM)\n",
    "3. **✅ Segmentation des locuteurs** (annotations réelles du corpus AMI)\n",

    "### 🎯 Points Clés SDM :\n",
    "- **SDM** = Single Distant Microphone (microphone distant unique)\n",
    "- Le corpus AMI SDM fournit des données **mono** de haute qualité\n",
    "- La **segmentation des locuteurs** est disponible dans les annotations\n",
    "- Configuration **idéale pour tester** les algorithmes de diarisation sur signal mono\n",
    "- **Signal plus simple** que MDM mais toujours représentatif des conditions réelles\n",
    "\n",
    "### 📊 Avantages de la configuration SDM :\n",
    "- **Simplicité** : Un seul canal audio à traiter\n",
    "- **Efficacité** : Moins de données, traitement plus rapide\n",
    "- **Réalisme** : Simule des conditions d'enregistrement courantes\n",
    "- **Compatibilité** : Fonctionne avec tous les algorithmes de diarisation\n",
